# ContextIQ

Hybrid-search RAG document Q&A platform: pgvector semantic search + PostgreSQL
full-text search, fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), with source-grounded
citations via the Claude API. See `~/Downloads/contextIQ_proposal.pdf` for the
full proposal (objectives, FR/NFR tables, architecture, timeline).

## Stack

- **Backend API**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+), async
- **Embeddings**: sentence-transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`), local, no per-call cost
- **Vector store**: PostgreSQL + pgvector
- **Keyword search**: PostgreSQL native full-text search (`tsvector`/`tsquery`)
- **Result fusion**: Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF, k=60 default), implemented in Python
- **Generation**: Claude API, strict context-only prompting
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Deployment**: Railway / Render / Fly.io

## Module boundaries (NFR-5)

Ingestion / retrieval / generation / API must stay separate. Concretely:

- **`ingestion/`** (extraction, chunking, embedding, `pipeline.py`): owns turning an
  uploaded file into stored chunks + embeddings + tsvectors. Never calls retrieval,
  generation, or route code.
- **`retrieval/`** (`semantic.py`, `keyword.py`, `fusion.py`, `retriever.py`): owns
  turning a query into ranked chunks. `retriever.py` is the single dispatch point
  for retrieval mode (FR-15) and is shared by the API and the evaluation harness.
  Never does prompt construction or calls the Claude API.
- **`generation/`** (`claude_client.py`, `prompt_builder.py`): owns building the
  grounded prompt and calling Claude. Never queries the database or performs
  retrieval itself — it only accepts chunks that were already retrieved.
- **`api/`**: routes + request/response wiring only. No extraction, retrieval, or
  generation logic lives here — routes call into `services/`, which orchestrates
  `ingestion/`, `retrieval/`, `generation/`, and `repositories/`.

Rule of thumb: a file in one of these four layers should never import
implementation internals from another layer — only the narrow function
signatures each module exposes (e.g. `retriever.retrieve(...)`,
`generation.generate(...)`).

## Current scope: Week 3 next

Per the delivery timeline: Week 1 (ingestion pipeline) and Week 2 (semantic +
keyword retrieval, RRF fusion, grounded Claude generation with citations,
`/query` endpoint) are complete. Week 3 = **frontend + retrieval debug view**
is next; evaluation harness work stays Week 4.

If a task seems to require working ahead of the current week, stop and flag it
rather than implementing it early — scope creep is a named project risk.
